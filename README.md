Welcome to the MEAN stack tutorial! This tutorial will teach you how to build a full stack web application using the MEAN stack. The final project will be an employee management system. You can find the source code for this tutorial on Github.

What is the MEAN stack?
What will this tutorial cover?
Getting started

Installing dependencies
Create an employee interface on the server side
Connect to the database
Build the RESTful API
Building the client-side Angular web application

Conclusion
But first things first, let's start with the basics.

What is the MEAN stack?
MEAN is a technology stack used for building full stack applications. It's a combination of the following technologies:

MongoDB—document database
Express—a Node.js framework for building APIs
Angular—front-end application framework
Node.js—server-side JavaScript runtime environment
Applications built with the MEAN stack follow the client-server architecture. The client, built with Angular, can be a web application, a native mobile application, or a desktop application. The client communicates with the server through an API, which is built with Express. The server then manages the requests with the MongoDB database.
